# Deliverable 1:  
## Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the `sample_values` as the values, the `otu_ids` as the labels, and the `otu_labels` as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Your bar chart should look like the following image:

    - The top 10 `sample_values` are sorted in descending order
    - The top 10 `sample_values` as values
