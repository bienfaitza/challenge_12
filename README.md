# Deliverable 1:  
## Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, i created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the `sample_values` as the values, the `otu_ids` as the labels, and the `otu_labels` as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

The bar chart is on the following image:

4. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, **ID 940**’s data are be displayed in the dashboard, and the bar chart has the following:
    - The top 10 `sample_values` are sorted in descending order
    - The top 10 `sample_values` as values
    - The `otu_ids` as the labels

Using  JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, i created a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

- The `otu_ids` as the x-axis values.
- The `sample_values` as the y-axis values.
